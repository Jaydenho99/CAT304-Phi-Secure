# Phi Secure: Raising Phishing Awareness through Gamification

A new Flutter project.

## Introduction
Cybersecurity awareness is often overlooked and neglected by the public and society due to a
lack of exposure to the importance of security. As a result, highly talented cybercriminals are
taking this opportunity to develop an advanced hacking method to obtain private information
and credentials from the public. One of the mentioned methods is called phishing attacks.
Phishing attacks are the most common type of cybersecurity breach, and it was reported that
91% of cyber-attacks are caused by phishing scams.

## Objective
Attackers use phishing emails to get hold of sensitive information or gain permanent
access to devices and accounts by masquerading as a trusted provider. So we are looking to
find new and innovative ways to ensure that users are always aware and check their sender
and salutation, ensure links and attachments are valid and to never provide their credentials
on non-company websites. Hence,our ultimate goal is to find additional training possibilities
with gamification concepts used in e-quizzes aimed to make the teaching and learning more
attractive and motivating in formative assessment as gamification requirements emphasise
analysing the objective needs, practises, and motivations of students.
